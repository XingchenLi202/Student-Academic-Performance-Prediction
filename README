To run this code,
The dataset have been included.
The user just need to run the code.
There are multiple function you can choose keep it or not.

DataProcess:
    pre_process: type conversion
    get_data_and_label: divide the feature and label
    problem_num: merge dataset according to missions
        (you can imput 1, 2, 3)
    data_normalization: data normalization (three optional method)
FeatureSection:
    pca: implement PCA (optional)
    remove_features: remove 4 non-binary features (optional)
    get_best_feature_number: get the best number of feature
        (best feature number = 15)
    feature_sel: get the index of best 15 feature
    get_feature: extract the 15 feature from dataset
Models:
    model_KNN: K-Nearest-Neighbors
    model_LinearRegre: Linear Regression
    model_trivial_sys: Trivial System
    model_SVR: Support Vector Regression
    model_randomforest: Random Forest Regression
    model_ridge: Ridge Regression
    get_models: get all models that I used and its predicted y
    model_best_KNN: best KNN
        (Mission 1: k=8, Mission 2: k=5, Mission 3: k=3)
    model_best_RF: best Random Forest Regression
        (Mission 1: n_estimators=56, Mission 2: n_estimators=46, Mission 3: n_estimators=35)
    model_best_ridge: best Ridge Regression
        (Mission 1: alphas=0.11, Mission 2: alphas=0.15, Mission 3: alphas=0.11)
Measurements:
    perf_measures: get RMSE, MAE, R-square
    get_best_fold: get best fold number of cross validation
        (best number of fold = 5)
    cross_val_comp: get better RMSE, MAE, R-square, accuracy of every model
Main:
    1. get data
    2. normalization
    3. get data and label
    4. re-merge dataset based on different missions
    5. get all models using default parameter
    6. get best number of feature
    7. select k best features
    8. extract the features
    9. optimize KNN, RF, Ridge and get best parameter using cross-validation
    10.get measurements using best parameters
    11.get best number of fold of cross-validation
    12.use 5 fold cross-validation get better results
